## What is WiFiMon?  
WiFiMon is a Wi-Fi network monitoring and performance verification system. It is capable of detecting performance issues, visualising the achievable throughput of a wireless network per user and providing technical information about a Wi-Fi network (e.g. signal strength, link quality, bit rate, etc.). WiFiMon leverages on well-known performance verification tools (e.g. [Akamai Boomerang](https://github.com/akamai/boomerang) and [LibreSpeed Speedtest](https://github.com/librespeed/speedtest)) and, in addition, uses data from the Wi-Fi physical layer in order to gather a comprehensive set of Wi-Fi network performance metrics.
